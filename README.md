This is a repo I've created for figures and analysis I use in my BA intro lecture on Comparative Politics. 

Each week students are introduced to some more code in R. The idea is explicitly not that students can learn R from a tutorial but that code snippets every week allow them to get fascinated by the many opportunities R provides. 

Below is an overview of what the code for each week do: 

week 1: simple R code, how to install, how to load packages

week 2: 

week 3: 

week 4: reproduction of Figure 1 in: A Tear in the Iron Curtain: The Impact of Western Television on Consumption Behavior (https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/98/1/25/58291/A-Tear-in-the-Iron-Curtain-The-Impact-of-Western?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
